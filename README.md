# Artificial-Neural-Network
An Artificial Neuron Network (ANN), popularly known as Neural Network is a computational model based on the structure and functions of biological neural networks. It is like an artificial human nervous system for receiving, processing, and transmitting information in terms of Computer Science.
It isacomputational system inspired by the
Structure
Processing Method
Learning Ability
of a biological brain
- Characteristics of Artificial Neural Networks
A large number of very simple processing neuron-lik e processing
elements
A large number of weighted connections between the elements
Distributed representation of knowledge over the connections
Knowledge is acquired by network through a learning process
Basically, there are 3 different layers in a neural network :-
Input Layer (All the inputs are fed in the model through this layer)
Hidden Layers (There can be more than one hidden layers which are used for processing the inputs received from the input layers)
Output Layer (The data after processing is made available at the output layer)
Furthermore the learning happens in two steps:
Forward-Propagation
Back-Propagation
Components of artificial neural networks
A neural network is characterized by
1) Its pattern of connections between the neurons (called its
architecture).
2) Its method of determining the weights on the connections (called its
training, or learning, algorithm).
3) Its activation function.
APPLICATION:
- Pattern Classification
- Clustering/Categorization
- Function approximation
- Prediction/Forecasting
- Optimization
- Content-addressable Memory
- Control
â€¢ Two Successful Applications
- Zipcode Recognition
- Text to voice translation (NeTtalk)
